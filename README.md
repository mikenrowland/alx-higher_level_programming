# ALX Higher Level Programming

## Welcome to the Python world!

### Disclaimer

* The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
* Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General

* Why Python programming is awesome
* Who created Python
* Who is Guido van Rossum
* Where does the name Python come from
* What is the Zen of Python
* How to use the Python interpreter
* How to print text and variables using print
* How to use strings
* What are indexing and slicing in Python
* What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

## Requirements

### Technologies

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)

### Code

* All files should end with a new line
* All code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
* All files must be executable

## Pycodestyle

Pycodestyle is now the new standard of Python style code
